# Juqe
A collaborative song voting system for parties, powered by Spotify.

## Known issues:
Due to [a bug](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/537) in the Spotify
Web API, the auto-generated Juqe playlist must be manually played from the
Spotify app when Juqe is started, otherwise tracks will not be queued.
