# Juke

A collaborative song voting system for parties, powered by Spotify.

## Known issues:
Due to a [bug](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/537) in the Spotify Web API, the auto-generated Juke playlist must be manually played from the Spotify app when Juke is started, otherwise songs cannot be queued.
